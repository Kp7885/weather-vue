## 📌 Step 2 — Ensure CI/CD Already Working

You already deployed via Vercel ✔  
Just confirm that Vercel GitHub integration is ON:

📍 Vercel → Project → Settings → Git Integration  
✔ Connected to main branch  
✔ Auto-deploy on push enabled

Let me know if you want me to generate a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` too — optional now since Vercel handles CI/CD automatically 💪
